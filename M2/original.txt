CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole


Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, â€œand what is the use of a book,â€ thought Alice
â€œwithout pictures or conversations?â€

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, â€œOh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!â€ (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled â€œORANGE MARMALADEâ€, but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.

â€œWell!â€ thought Alice to herself, â€œafter such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyâ€™ll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldnâ€™t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!â€ (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? â€œI wonder how
many miles Iâ€™ve fallen by this time?â€ she said aloud. â€œI must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I thinkâ€”â€ (for, you see, Alice had learnt
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over) â€œâ€”yes, thatâ€™s about the right distanceâ€”but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Iâ€™ve got to?â€ (Alice had no
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. â€œI wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny itâ€™ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkâ€”â€ (she was rather
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnâ€™t sound at all
the right word) â€œâ€”but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, Maâ€™am, is this New Zealand or Australia?â€
(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâ€”fancy _curtseying_ as youâ€™re
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) â€œAnd what
an ignorant little girl sheâ€™ll think me for asking! No, itâ€™ll never do
to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.â€

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. â€œDinahâ€™ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!â€
(Dinah was the cat.) â€œI hope theyâ€™ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
no mice in the air, Iâ€™m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatâ€™s
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?â€ And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, â€œDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?â€ and
sometimes, â€œDo bats eat cats?â€ for, you see, as she couldnâ€™t answer
either question, it didnâ€™t much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
â€œNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?â€ when suddenly,
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, â€œOh my ears
and whiskers, how late itâ€™s getting!â€ She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Aliceâ€™s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; â€œand even if my head would go through,â€ thought
poor Alice, â€œit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin.â€ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, (â€œwhich certainly was not here
before,â€ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words â€œDRINK ME,â€ beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say â€œDrink me,â€ but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. â€œNo, Iâ€™ll look first,â€ she said,
â€œand see whether itâ€™s marked â€˜_poison_â€™ or notâ€; for she had read
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked â€œpoison,â€ it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.

However, this bottle was _not_ marked â€œpoison,â€ so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


â€œWhat a curious feeling!â€ said Alice; â€œI must be shutting up like a
telescope.â€

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; â€œfor it might end, you know,â€
said Alice to herself, â€œin my going out altogether, like a candle. I
wonder what I should be like then?â€ And she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.

â€œCome, thereâ€™s no use in crying like that!â€ said Alice to herself,
rather sharply; â€œI advise you to leave off this minute!â€ She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
â€œBut itâ€™s no use now,â€ thought poor Alice, â€œto pretend to be two
people! Why, thereâ€™s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
person!â€

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
â€œEAT MEâ€ were beautifully marked in currants. â€œWell, Iâ€™ll eat it,â€ said
Alice, â€œand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way Iâ€™ll
get into the garden, and I donâ€™t care which happens!â€

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, â€œWhich way? Which
way?â€, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *




CHAPTER II.
The Pool of Tears


â€œCuriouser and curiouser!â€ cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); â€œnow Iâ€™m
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!â€
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). â€œOh, my poor little feet, I
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? Iâ€™m
sure _I_ shanâ€™t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;â€”but I must be
kind to them,â€ thought Alice, â€œor perhaps they wonâ€™t walk the way I
want to go! Let me see: Iâ€™ll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas.â€

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. â€œThey must
go by the carrier,â€ she thought; â€œand how funny itâ€™ll seem, sending
presents to oneâ€™s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     _Aliceâ€™s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
     Aliceâ€™s love_).

Oh dear, what nonsense Iâ€™m talking!â€

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

â€œYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,â€ said Alice, â€œa great girl like
you,â€ (she might well say this), â€œto go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you!â€ But she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, â€œOh! the Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh! wonâ€™t she be savage if Iâ€™ve kept her waiting!â€ Alice felt
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, â€œIf you please,
sirâ€”â€ The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: â€œDear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if Iâ€™ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
a little different. But if Iâ€™m not the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, _thatâ€™s_ the great puzzle!â€ And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

â€œIâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not Ada,â€ she said, â€œfor her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesnâ€™t go in ringlets at all; and Iâ€™m sure I canâ€™t
be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besides, _sheâ€™s_ she, and _Iâ€™m_ I, andâ€”oh dear, how
puzzling it all is! Iâ€™ll try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven isâ€”oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesnâ€™t signify: letâ€™s try
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and Romeâ€”no, _thatâ€™s_ all wrong, Iâ€™m certain! I must have been
changed for Mabel! Iâ€™ll try and say â€˜_How doth the little_â€”â€™â€ and she
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
did not come the same as they used to do:â€”

â€œHow doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!

â€œHow cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!â€


â€œIâ€™m sure those are not the right words,â€ said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, â€œI must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, Iâ€™ve
made up my mind about it; if Iâ€™m Mabel, Iâ€™ll stay down here! Itâ€™ll be
no use their putting their heads down and saying â€˜Come up again, dear!â€™
I shall only look up and say â€˜Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
then, if I like being that person, Iâ€™ll come up: if not, Iâ€™ll stay down
here till Iâ€™m somebody elseâ€™â€”but, oh dear!â€ cried Alice, with a sudden
burst of tears, â€œI do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
_very_ tired of being all alone here!â€

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the Rabbitâ€™s little white kid gloves while
she was talking. â€œHow _can_ I have done that?â€ she thought. â€œI must be
growing small again.â€ She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

â€œThat _was_ a narrow escape!â€ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; â€œand
now for the garden!â€ and she ran with all speed back to the little
door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
key was lying on the glass table as before, â€œand things are worse than
ever,â€ thought the poor child, â€œfor I never was so small as this
before, never! And I declare itâ€™s too bad, that it is!â€

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, â€œand in that case I can go back by
railway,â€ she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
she was nine feet high.

â€œI wish I hadnâ€™t cried so much!â€ said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. â€œI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
sure! However, everything is queer to-day.â€

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

â€œWould it be of any use, now,â€ thought Alice, â€œto speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, thereâ€™s no harm in trying.â€ So she
began: â€œO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!â€ (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brotherâ€™s Latin Grammar, â€œA mouseâ€”of
a mouseâ€”to a mouseâ€”a mouseâ€”O mouse!â€) The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.

â€œPerhaps it doesnâ€™t understand English,â€ thought Alice; â€œI daresay itâ€™s
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.â€ (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: â€œOÃ¹ est ma chatte?â€ which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. â€œOh, I beg your pardon!â€ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
had hurt the poor animalâ€™s feelings. â€œI quite forgot you didnâ€™t like
cats.â€

â€œNot like cats!â€ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. â€œWould
_you_ like cats if you were me?â€

â€œWell, perhaps not,â€ said Alice in a soothing tone: â€œdonâ€™t be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think youâ€™d
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
quiet thing,â€ Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
in the pool, â€œand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
paws and washing her faceâ€”and she is such a nice soft thing to
nurseâ€”and sheâ€™s such a capital one for catching miceâ€”oh, I beg your
pardon!â€ cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. â€œWe wonâ€™t talk
about her any more if youâ€™d rather not.â€

â€œWe indeed!â€ cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. â€œAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Donâ€™t let me hear the name
again!â€

â€œI wonâ€™t indeed!â€ said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. â€œAre youâ€”are you fondâ€”ofâ€”of dogs?â€ The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: â€œThere is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And itâ€™ll fetch things when
you throw them, and itâ€™ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of thingsâ€”I canâ€™t remember half of themâ€”and it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says itâ€™s so useful, itâ€™s worth a hundred pounds! He says
it kills all the rats andâ€”oh dear!â€ cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
â€œIâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ve offended it again!â€ For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, â€œMouse dear! Do come back again, and we
wonâ€™t talk about cats or dogs either, if you donâ€™t like them!â€ When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, â€œLet us get to the shore, and then Iâ€™ll tell you my
history, and youâ€™ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.â€

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale


They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bankâ€”the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, â€œI am
older than you, and must know better;â€ and this Alice would not allow
without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
tell its age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, â€œSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _Iâ€™ll_ soon make
you dry enough!â€ They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

â€œAhem!â€ said the Mouse with an important air, â€œare you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! â€˜William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbriaâ€”â€™â€

â€œUgh!â€ said the Lory, with a shiver.

â€œI beg your pardon!â€ said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: â€œDid
you speak?â€

â€œNot I!â€ said the Lory hastily.

â€œI thought you did,â€ said the Mouse. â€œâ€”I proceed. â€˜Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisableâ€”â€™â€

â€œFound _what_?â€ said the Duck.

â€œFound _it_,â€ the Mouse replied rather crossly: â€œof course you know
what â€˜itâ€™ means.â€

â€œI know what â€˜itâ€™ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,â€ said the
Duck: â€œitâ€™s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?â€

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, â€œâ€˜â€”found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
the crown. Williamâ€™s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
of his Normansâ€”â€™ How are you getting on now, my dear?â€ it continued,
turning to Alice as it spoke.

â€œAs wet as ever,â€ said Alice in a melancholy tone: â€œit doesnâ€™t seem to
dry me at all.â€

â€œIn that case,â€ said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, â€œI move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remediesâ€”â€

â€œSpeak English!â€ said the Eaglet. â€œI donâ€™t know the meaning of half
those long words, and, whatâ€™s more, I donâ€™t believe you do either!â€ And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

â€œWhat I was going to say,â€ said the Dodo in an offended tone, â€œwas,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.â€

â€œWhat _is_ a Caucus-race?â€ said Alice; not that she wanted much to
know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

â€œWhy,â€ said the Dodo, â€œthe best way to explain it is to do it.â€ (And,
as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (â€œthe exact
shape doesnâ€™t matter,â€ it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no â€œOne, two, three, and
away,â€ but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out â€œThe race is over!â€ and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, â€œBut who has won?â€

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
said, â€œ_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.â€

â€œBut who is to give the prizes?â€ quite a chorus of voices asked.

â€œWhy, _she_, of course,â€ said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
confused way, â€œPrizes! Prizes!â€

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
one a-piece, all round.

â€œBut she must have a prize herself, you know,â€ said the Mouse.

â€œOf course,â€ the Dodo replied very gravely. â€œWhat else have you got in
your pocket?â€ he went on, turning to Alice.

â€œOnly a thimble,â€ said Alice sadly.

â€œHand it over here,â€ said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying â€œWe beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble;â€ and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
cheered.

Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
she could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

â€œYou promised to tell me your history, you know,â€ said Alice, â€œand why
it is you hateâ€”C and D,â€ she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

â€œMine is a long and a sad tale!â€ said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
sighing.

â€œIt _is_ a long tail, certainly,â€ said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouseâ€™s tail; â€œbut why do you call it sad?â€ And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:â€”

         â€œFury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, â€˜Let us both
         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.â€”Come, Iâ€™ll take no
         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning Iâ€™ve
         nothing to do.â€™ Said the mouse to the cur, â€˜Such a trial, dear
         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.â€™
         â€˜Iâ€™ll be judge, Iâ€™ll be jury,â€™ Said cunning old Fury: â€˜Iâ€™ll
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.â€™â€

â€œYou are not attending!â€ said the Mouse to Alice severely. â€œWhat are
you thinking of?â€

â€œI beg your pardon,â€ said Alice very humbly: â€œyou had got to the fifth
bend, I think?â€

â€œI had _not!_â€ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

â€œA knot!â€ said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. â€œOh, do let me help to undo it!â€

â€œI shall do nothing of the sort,â€ said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away. â€œYou insult me by talking such nonsense!â€

â€œI didnâ€™t mean it!â€ pleaded poor Alice. â€œBut youâ€™re so easily offended,
you know!â€

The Mouse only growled in reply.

â€œPlease come back and finish your story!â€ Alice called after it; and
the others all joined in chorus, â€œYes, please do!â€ but the Mouse only
shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

â€œWhat a pity it wouldnâ€™t stay!â€ sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
her daughter â€œAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper!â€ â€œHold your tongue, Ma!â€ said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. â€œYouâ€™re enough to try the patience of an oyster!â€

â€œI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!â€ said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. â€œSheâ€™d soon fetch it back!â€

â€œAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?â€ said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
â€œDinahâ€™s our cat. And sheâ€™s such a capital one for catching mice you
canâ€™t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
sheâ€™ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!â€

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, â€œI really must be getting home; the night-air
doesnâ€™t suit my throat!â€ and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
to its children, â€œCome away, my dears! Itâ€™s high time you were all in
bed!â€ On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
alone.

â€œI wish I hadnâ€™t mentioned Dinah!â€ she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. â€œNobody seems to like her, down here, and Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™s the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!â€ And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
coming back to finish his story.




CHAPTER IV.
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself â€œThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! Sheâ€™ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?â€ Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to be seenâ€”everything seemed to have changed since
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
little door, had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, â€œWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan! Quick, now!â€ And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
mistake it had made.

â€œHe took me for his housemaid,â€ she said to herself as she ran. â€œHow
surprised heâ€™ll be when he finds out who I am! But Iâ€™d better take him
his fan and glovesâ€”that is, if I can find them.â€ As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name â€œW. RABBIT,â€ engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

â€œHow queer it seems,â€ Alice said to herself, â€œto be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinahâ€™ll be sending me on messages next!â€ And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: â€œâ€˜Miss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!â€™ â€˜Coming in a minute,
nurse! But Iâ€™ve got to see that the mouse doesnâ€™t get out.â€™ Only I
donâ€™t think,â€ Alice went on, â€œthat theyâ€™d let Dinah stop in the house
if it began ordering people about like that!â€

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
this time with the words â€œDRINK ME,â€ but nevertheless she uncorked it
and put it to her lips. â€œI know _something_ interesting is sure to
happen,â€ she said to herself, â€œwhenever I eat or drink anything; so
Iâ€™ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itâ€™ll make me grow large
again, for really Iâ€™m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!â€

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself â€œThatâ€™s quite enoughâ€”I hope I shanâ€™t
grow any moreâ€”As it is, I canâ€™t get out at the doorâ€”I do wish I hadnâ€™t
drunk quite so much!â€

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself â€œNow I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?â€

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

â€œIt was much pleasanter at home,â€ thought poor Alice, â€œwhen one wasnâ€™t
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadnâ€™t gone down that rabbit-holeâ€”and yetâ€”and
yetâ€”itâ€™s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, Iâ€™ll write oneâ€”but Iâ€™m grown up now,â€ she added in a
sorrowful tone; â€œat least thereâ€™s no room to grow up any more _here_.â€

â€œBut then,â€ thought Alice, â€œshall I _never_ get any older than I am
now? Thatâ€™ll be a comfort, one wayâ€”never to be an old womanâ€”but
thenâ€”always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnâ€™t like _that!_â€

â€œOh, you foolish Alice!â€ she answered herself. â€œHow can you learn
lessons in here? Why, thereâ€™s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!â€

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

â€œMary Ann! Mary Ann!â€ said the voice. â€œFetch me my gloves this moment!â€
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Aliceâ€™s elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself â€œThen Iâ€™ll
go round and get in at the window.â€

â€œ_That_ you wonâ€™t!â€ thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voiceâ€”the Rabbitâ€™sâ€”â€œPat! Pat! Where are you?â€ And
then a voice she had never heard before, â€œSure then Iâ€™m here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!â€

â€œDigging for apples, indeed!â€ said the Rabbit angrily. â€œHere! Come and
help me out of _this!_â€ (Sounds of more broken glass.)

â€œNow tell me, Pat, whatâ€™s that in the window?â€

â€œSure, itâ€™s an arm, yer honour!â€ (He pronounced it â€œarrum.â€)

â€œAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!â€

â€œSure, it does, yer honour: but itâ€™s an arm for all that.â€

â€œWell, itâ€™s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!â€

There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, â€œSure, I donâ€™t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!â€ â€œDo as I tell you, you coward!â€ and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. â€œWhat a number
of cucumber-frames there must be!â€ thought Alice. â€œI wonder what
theyâ€™ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
_could!_ Iâ€™m sure _I_ donâ€™t want to stay in here any longer!â€

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she made out the words: â€œWhereâ€™s the other
ladder?â€”Why, I hadnâ€™t to bring but one; Billâ€™s got the otherâ€”Bill!
fetch it here, lad!â€”Here, put â€™em up at this cornerâ€”No, tie â€™em
together firstâ€”they donâ€™t reach half high enough yetâ€”Oh! theyâ€™ll do
well enough; donâ€™t be particularâ€”Here, Bill! catch hold of this
ropeâ€”Will the roof bear?â€”Mind that loose slateâ€”Oh, itâ€™s coming down!
Heads below!â€ (a loud crash)â€”â€œNow, who did that?â€”It was Bill, I
fancyâ€”Whoâ€™s to go down the chimney?â€”Nay, _I_ shanâ€™t! _You_ do
it!â€”_That_ I wonâ€™t, then!â€”Billâ€™s to go downâ€”Here, Bill! the master says
youâ€™re to go down the chimney!â€

â€œOh! So Billâ€™s got to come down the chimney, has he?â€ said Alice to
herself. â€œShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnâ€™t be in
Billâ€™s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
I _think_ I can kick a little!â€

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal (she couldnâ€™t guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself â€œThis is Bill,â€ she gave one sharp kick, and waited
to see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of â€œThere goes Bill!â€
then the Rabbitâ€™s voice alongâ€”â€œCatch him, you by the hedge!â€ then
silence, and then another confusion of voicesâ€”â€œHold up his headâ€”Brandy
nowâ€”Donâ€™t choke himâ€”How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!â€

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (â€œThatâ€™s Bill,â€ thought
Alice,) â€œWell, I hardly knowâ€”No more, thank ye; Iâ€™m better nowâ€”but Iâ€™m
a deal too flustered to tell youâ€”all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!â€

â€œSo you did, old fellow!â€ said the others.

â€œWe must burn the house down!â€ said the Rabbitâ€™s voice; and Alice
called out as loud as she could, â€œIf you do, Iâ€™ll set Dinah at you!â€

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, â€œI
wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, theyâ€™d take the
roof off.â€ After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, â€œA barrowful will do, to begin with.â€

â€œA barrowful of _what?_â€ thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. â€œIâ€™ll put a stop to
this,â€ she said to herself, and shouted out, â€œYouâ€™d better not do that
again!â€ which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. â€œIf I eat one of these cakes,â€ she thought, â€œitâ€™s sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and as it canâ€™t possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, I suppose.â€

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

â€œThe first thing Iâ€™ve got to do,â€ said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, â€œis to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
will be the best plan.â€

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.

An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. â€œPoor little
thing!â€ said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppyâ€™s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

â€œAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!â€ said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: â€œI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifâ€”if Iâ€™d
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! Iâ€™d nearly forgotten that
Iâ€™ve got to grow up again! Let me seeâ€”how _is_ it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?â€

The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a
long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything
else.




CHAPTER V.
Advice from a Caterpillar


The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

â€œWho are _you?_â€ said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, â€œIâ€”I hardly know, sir, just at presentâ€”at least I know
who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.â€

â€œWhat do you mean by that?â€ said the Caterpillar sternly. â€œExplain
yourself!â€

â€œI canâ€™t explain _myself_, Iâ€™m afraid, sir,â€ said Alice, â€œbecause Iâ€™m
not myself, you see.â€

â€œI donâ€™t see,â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œIâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t put it more clearly,â€ Alice replied very politely,
â€œfor I canâ€™t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.â€

â€œIt isnâ€™t,â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œWell, perhaps you havenâ€™t found it so yet,â€ said Alice; â€œbut when you
have to turn into a chrysalisâ€”you will some day, you knowâ€”and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think youâ€™ll feel it a little
queer, wonâ€™t you?â€

â€œNot a bit,â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,â€ said Alice; â€œall I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_.â€

â€œYou!â€ said the Caterpillar contemptuously. â€œWho are _you?_â€

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillarâ€™s making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, â€œI
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.â€

â€œWhy?â€ said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

â€œCome back!â€ the Caterpillar called after her. â€œIâ€™ve something
important to say!â€

This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.

â€œKeep your temper,â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œIs that all?â€ said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.

â€œNo,â€ said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, â€œSo you
think youâ€™re changed, do you?â€

â€œIâ€™m afraid I am, sir,â€ said Alice; â€œI canâ€™t remember things as I
usedâ€”and I donâ€™t keep the same size for ten minutes together!â€

â€œCanâ€™t remember _what_ things?â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œWell, Iâ€™ve tried to say â€œHow doth the little busy bee,â€ but it all
came different!â€ Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

â€œRepeat, â€œ_You are old, Father William_,â€™â€ said the Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:â€”

â€œYou are old, Father William,â€ the young man said,
    â€œAnd your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your headâ€”
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?â€

â€œIn my youth,â€ Father William replied to his son,
    â€œI feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that Iâ€™m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.â€

â€œYou are old,â€ said the youth, â€œas I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the doorâ€”
    Pray, what is the reason of that?â€

â€œIn my youth,â€ said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    â€œI kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointmentâ€”one shilling the boxâ€”
    Allow me to sell you a couple?â€

â€œYou are old,â€ said the youth, â€œand your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beakâ€”
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?â€

â€œIn my youth,â€ said his father, â€œI took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.â€

â€œYou are old,â€ said the youth, â€œone would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your noseâ€”
    What made you so awfully clever?â€

â€œI have answered three questions, and that is enough,â€
    Said his father; â€œdonâ€™t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or Iâ€™ll kick you down stairs!â€


â€œThat is not said right,â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œNot _quite_ right, Iâ€™m afraid,â€ said Alice, timidly; â€œsome of the
words have got altered.â€

â€œIt is wrong from beginning to end,â€ said the Caterpillar decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

â€œWhat size do you want to be?â€ it asked.

â€œOh, Iâ€™m not particular as to size,â€ Alice hastily replied; â€œonly one
doesnâ€™t like changing so often, you know.â€

â€œI _donâ€™t_ know,â€ said the Caterpillar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

â€œAre you content now?â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œWell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldnâ€™t
mind,â€ said Alice: â€œthree inches is such a wretched height to be.â€

â€œIt is a very good height indeed!â€ said the Caterpillar angrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

â€œBut Iâ€™m not used to it!â€ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
thought of herself, â€œI wish the creatures wouldnâ€™t be so easily
offended!â€

â€œYouâ€™ll get used to it in time,â€ said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
â€œOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.â€

â€œOne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_â€ thought Alice to
herself.

â€œOf the mushroom,â€ said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
off a bit of the edge with each hand.

â€œAnd now which is which?â€ she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


â€œCome, my headâ€™s free at last!â€ said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

â€œWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?â€ said Alice. â€œAnd where _have_ my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I canâ€™t see you?â€
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.

â€œSerpent!â€ screamed the Pigeon.

â€œIâ€™m _not_ a serpent!â€ said Alice indignantly. â€œLet me alone!â€

â€œSerpent, I say again!â€ repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added with a kind of sob, â€œIâ€™ve tried every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!â€

â€œI havenâ€™t the least idea what youâ€™re talking about,â€ said Alice.

â€œIâ€™ve tried the roots of trees, and Iâ€™ve tried banks, and Iâ€™ve tried
hedges,â€ the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; â€œbut those
serpents! Thereâ€™s no pleasing them!â€

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

â€œAs if it wasnâ€™t trouble enough hatching the eggs,â€ said the Pigeon;
â€œbut I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
havenâ€™t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!â€

â€œIâ€™m very sorry youâ€™ve been annoyed,â€ said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

â€œAnd just as Iâ€™d taken the highest tree in the wood,â€ continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, â€œand just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!â€

â€œBut Iâ€™m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!â€ said Alice. â€œIâ€™m aâ€”Iâ€™m aâ€”â€

â€œWell! _What_ are you?â€ said the Pigeon. â€œI can see youâ€™re trying to
invent something!â€

â€œIâ€”Iâ€™m a little girl,â€ said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

â€œA likely story indeed!â€ said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. â€œIâ€™ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! Youâ€™re a serpent; and thereâ€™s
no use denying it. I suppose youâ€™ll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!â€

â€œI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,â€ said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; â€œbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.â€

â€œI donâ€™t believe it,â€ said the Pigeon; â€œbut if they do, why then
theyâ€™re a kind of serpent, thatâ€™s all I can say.â€

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, â€œYouâ€™re
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether youâ€™re a little girl or a serpent?â€

â€œIt matters a good deal to _me_,â€ said Alice hastily; â€œbut Iâ€™m not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldnâ€™t want
_yours_: I donâ€™t like them raw.â€

â€œWell, be off, then!â€ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. â€œCome, thereâ€™s half my plan
done now! How puzzling all these changes are! Iâ€™m never sure what Iâ€™m
going to be, from one minute to another! However, Iâ€™ve got back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenâ€”how
_is_ that to be done, I wonder?â€ As she said this, she came suddenly
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
â€œWhoever lives there,â€ thought Alice, â€œitâ€™ll never do to come upon them
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!â€ So she
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.




CHAPTER VI.
Pig and Pepper


For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
woodâ€”(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish)â€”and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, â€œFor the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet.â€ The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, â€œFrom the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.â€

Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

â€œThereâ€™s no sort of use in knocking,â€ said the Footman, â€œand that for
two reasons. First, because Iâ€™m on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because theyâ€™re making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you.â€ And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
noise going on withinâ€”a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.

â€œPlease, then,â€ said Alice, â€œhow am I to get in?â€

â€œThere might be some sense in your knocking,â€ the Footman went on
without attending to her, â€œif we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know.â€ He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. â€œBut perhaps he canâ€™t help it,â€
she said to herself; â€œhis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.â€”How am I to get in?â€
she repeated, aloud.

â€œI shall sit here,â€ the Footman remarked, â€œtill tomorrowâ€”â€

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footmanâ€™s head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

â€œâ€”or next day, maybe,â€ the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

â€œHow am I to get in?â€ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

â€œ_Are_ you to get in at all?â€ said the Footman. â€œThatâ€™s the first
question, you know.â€

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. â€œItâ€™s really
dreadful,â€ she muttered to herself, â€œthe way all the creatures argue.
Itâ€™s enough to drive one crazy!â€

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. â€œI shall sit here,â€ he said, â€œon and off, for
days and days.â€

â€œBut what am _I_ to do?â€ said Alice.

â€œAnything you like,â€ said the Footman, and began whistling.

â€œOh, thereâ€™s no use in talking to him,â€ said Alice desperately: â€œheâ€™s
perfectly idiotic!â€ And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

â€œThereâ€™s certainly too much pepper in that soup!â€ Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a momentâ€™s pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

â€œPlease would you tell me,â€ said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, â€œwhy
your cat grins like that?â€

â€œItâ€™s a Cheshire cat,â€ said the Duchess, â€œand thatâ€™s why. Pig!â€

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:â€”

â€œI didnâ€™t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didnâ€™t
know that cats _could_ grin.â€

â€œThey all can,â€ said the Duchess; â€œand most of â€™em do.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know of any that do,â€ Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

â€œYou donâ€™t know much,â€ said the Duchess; â€œand thatâ€™s a fact.â€

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the babyâ€”the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

â€œOh, _please_ mind what youâ€™re doing!â€ cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror. â€œOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!â€ as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.

â€œIf everybody minded their own business,â€ the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, â€œthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.â€

â€œWhich would _not_ be an advantage,â€ said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. â€œJust
think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axisâ€”â€

â€œTalking of axes,â€ said the Duchess, â€œchop off her head!â€

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: â€œTwenty-four hours, I _think_; or
is it twelve? Iâ€”â€

â€œOh, donâ€™t bother _me_,â€ said the Duchess; â€œI never could abide
figures!â€ And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:

â€œSpeak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.â€


CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):


â€œWow! wow! wow!â€


While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:â€”

â€œI speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!â€


CHORUS.


â€œWow! wow! wow!â€


â€œHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!â€ the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. â€œI must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,â€ and she hurried out of the room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
â€œjust like a star-fish,â€ thought Alice. The poor little thing was
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it
out into the open air. â€œIf I donâ€™t take this child away with me,â€
thought Alice, â€œtheyâ€™re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldnâ€™t it be
murder to leave it behind?â€ She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
â€œDonâ€™t grunt,â€ said Alice; â€œthatâ€™s not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.â€

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did
not like the look of the thing at all. â€œBut perhaps it was only
sobbing,â€ she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
were any tears.

No, there were no tears. â€œIf youâ€™re going to turn into a pig, my dear,â€
said Alice, seriously, â€œIâ€™ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!â€ The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, â€œNow, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home?â€ when it grunted again, so
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood. â€œIf it had grown up,â€ she said to
herself, â€œit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.â€ And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, â€œif one only knew the right way to change themâ€”â€ when she
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of
a tree a few yards off.

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

â€œCheshire Puss,â€ she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider. â€œCome, itâ€™s pleased so far,â€ thought Alice, and she went on.
â€œWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?â€

â€œThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,â€ said the Cat.

â€œI donâ€™t much care whereâ€”â€ said Alice.

â€œThen it doesnâ€™t matter which way you go,â€ said the Cat.

â€œâ€”so long as I get _somewhere_,â€ Alice added as an explanation.

â€œOh, youâ€™re sure to do that,â€ said the Cat, â€œif you only walk long
enough.â€

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question. â€œWhat sort of people live about here?â€

â€œIn _that_ direction,â€ the Cat said, waving its right paw round, â€œlives
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,â€ waving the other paw, â€œlives a
March Hare. Visit either you like: theyâ€™re both mad.â€

â€œBut I donâ€™t want to go among mad people,â€ Alice remarked.

â€œOh, you canâ€™t help that,â€ said the Cat: â€œweâ€™re all mad here. Iâ€™m mad.
Youâ€™re mad.â€

â€œHow do you know Iâ€™m mad?â€ said Alice.

â€œYou must be,â€ said the Cat, â€œor you wouldnâ€™t have come here.â€

Alice didnâ€™t think that proved it at all; however, she went on â€œAnd how
do you know that youâ€™re mad?â€

â€œTo begin with,â€ said the Cat, â€œa dogâ€™s not mad. You grant that?â€

â€œI suppose so,â€ said Alice.

â€œWell, then,â€ the Cat went on, â€œyou see, a dog growls when itâ€™s angry,
and wags its tail when itâ€™s pleased. Now _I_ growl when Iâ€™m pleased,
and wag my tail when Iâ€™m angry. Therefore Iâ€™m mad.â€

â€œ_I_ call it purring, not growling,â€ said Alice.

â€œCall it what you like,â€ said the Cat. â€œDo you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?â€

â€œI should like it very much,â€ said Alice, â€œbut I havenâ€™t been invited
yet.â€

â€œYouâ€™ll see me there,â€ said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

â€œBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?â€ said the Cat. â€œIâ€™d nearly
forgotten to ask.â€

â€œIt turned into a pig,â€ Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.

â€œI thought it would,â€ said the Cat, and vanished again.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. â€œIâ€™ve seen hatters before,â€ she
said to herself; â€œthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it wonâ€™t be raving madâ€”at least not so mad as it
was in March.â€ As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

â€œDid you say pig, or fig?â€ said the Cat.

â€œI said pig,â€ replied Alice; â€œand I wish you wouldnâ€™t keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.â€

â€œAll right,â€ said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

â€œWell! Iâ€™ve often seen a cat without a grin,â€ thought Alice; â€œbut a
grin without a cat! Itâ€™s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!â€

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself
to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself â€œSuppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish Iâ€™d gone to see the Hatter instead!â€




CHAPTER VII.
A Mad Tea-Party


There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. â€œVery
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,â€ thought Alice; â€œonly, as itâ€™s asleep,
I suppose it doesnâ€™t mind.â€

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: â€œNo room! No room!â€ they cried out when they saw
Alice coming. â€œThereâ€™s _plenty_ of room!â€ said Alice indignantly, and
she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

â€œHave some wine,â€ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
â€œI donâ€™t see any wine,â€ she remarked.

â€œThere isnâ€™t any,â€ said the March Hare.

â€œThen it wasnâ€™t very civil of you to offer it,â€ said Alice angrily.

â€œIt wasnâ€™t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,â€ said
the March Hare.

â€œI didnâ€™t know it was _your_ table,â€ said Alice; â€œitâ€™s laid for a great
many more than three.â€

â€œYour hair wants cutting,â€ said the Hatter. He had been looking at
Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
speech.

â€œYou should learn not to make personal remarks,â€ Alice said with some
severity; â€œitâ€™s very rude.â€

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
was, â€œWhy is a raven like a writing-desk?â€

â€œCome, we shall have some fun now!â€ thought Alice. â€œIâ€™m glad theyâ€™ve
begun asking riddles.â€”I believe I can guess that,â€ she added aloud.

â€œDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?â€ said
the March Hare.

â€œExactly so,â€ said Alice.

â€œThen you should say what you mean,â€ the March Hare went on.

â€œI do,â€ Alice hastily replied; â€œat leastâ€”at least I mean what I
sayâ€”thatâ€™s the same thing, you know.â€

â€œNot the same thing a bit!â€ said the Hatter. â€œYou might just as well
say that â€˜I see what I eatâ€™ is the same thing as â€˜I eat what I seeâ€™!â€

â€œYou might just as well say,â€ added the March Hare, â€œthat â€˜I like what
I getâ€™ is the same thing as â€˜I get what I likeâ€™!â€

â€œYou might just as well say,â€ added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, â€œthat â€˜I breathe when I sleepâ€™ is the same thing
as â€˜I sleep when I breatheâ€™!â€

â€œIt _is_ the same thing with you,â€ said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasnâ€™t much.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. â€œWhat day of the month
is it?â€ he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said â€œThe fourth.â€

â€œTwo days wrong!â€ sighed the Hatter. â€œI told you butter wouldnâ€™t suit
the works!â€ he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

â€œIt was the _best_ butter,â€ the March Hare meekly replied.

â€œYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,â€ the Hatter grumbled:
â€œyou shouldnâ€™t have put it in with the bread-knife.â€

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, â€œIt was the _best_ butter,
you know.â€

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. â€œWhat a
funny watch!â€ she remarked. â€œIt tells the day of the month, and doesnâ€™t
tell what oâ€™clock it is!â€

â€œWhy should it?â€ muttered the Hatter. â€œDoes _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?â€

â€œOf course not,â€ Alice replied very readily: â€œbut thatâ€™s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.â€

â€œWhich is just the case with _mine_,â€ said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatterâ€™s remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. â€œI donâ€™t quite
understand you,â€ she said, as politely as she could.

â€œThe Dormouse is asleep again,â€ said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, â€œOf course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.â€

â€œHave you guessed the riddle yet?â€ the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.

â€œNo, I give it up,â€ Alice replied: â€œwhatâ€™s the answer?â€

â€œI havenâ€™t the slightest idea,â€ said the Hatter.

â€œNor I,â€ said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. â€œI think you might do something better with the
time,â€ she said, â€œthan waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers.â€

â€œIf you knew Time as well as I do,â€ said the Hatter, â€œyou wouldnâ€™t talk
about wasting _it_. Itâ€™s _him_.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know what you mean,â€ said Alice.

â€œOf course you donâ€™t!â€ the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously. â€œI dare say you never even spoke to Time!â€

â€œPerhaps not,â€ Alice cautiously replied: â€œbut I know I have to beat
time when I learn music.â€

â€œAh! that accounts for it,â€ said the Hatter. â€œHe wonâ€™t stand beating.
Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, heâ€™d do almost anything
you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oâ€™clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: youâ€™d only have to whisper a
hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
time for dinner!â€

(â€œI only wish it was,â€ the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

â€œThat would be grand, certainly,â€ said Alice thoughtfully: â€œbut thenâ€”I
shouldnâ€™t be hungry for it, you know.â€

â€œNot at first, perhaps,â€ said the Hatter: â€œbut you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.â€

â€œIs that the way _you_ manage?â€ Alice asked.

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. â€œNot I!â€ he replied. â€œWe
quarrelled last Marchâ€”just before _he_ went mad, you knowâ€”â€ (pointing
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) â€œâ€”it was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

â€˜Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what youâ€™re at!â€™


You know the song, perhaps?â€

â€œIâ€™ve heard something like it,â€ said Alice.

â€œIt goes on, you know,â€ the Hatter continued, â€œin this way:â€”

â€˜Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkleâ€”â€™â€


Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
â€œ_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_â€”â€ and went on so long that they
had to pinch it to make it stop.

â€œWell, Iâ€™d hardly finished the first verse,â€ said the Hatter, â€œwhen the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, â€˜Heâ€™s murdering the time! Off with his
head!â€™â€

â€œHow dreadfully savage!â€ exclaimed Alice.

â€œAnd ever since that,â€ the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, â€œhe wonâ€™t
do a thing I ask! Itâ€™s always six oâ€™clock now.â€

A bright idea came into Aliceâ€™s head. â€œIs that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?â€ she asked.

â€œYes, thatâ€™s it,â€ said the Hatter with a sigh: â€œitâ€™s always tea-time,
and weâ€™ve no time to wash the things between whiles.â€

â€œThen you keep moving round, I suppose?â€ said Alice.

â€œExactly so,â€ said the Hatter: â€œas the things get used up.â€

â€œBut what happens when you come to the beginning again?â€ Alice ventured
to ask.

â€œSuppose we change the subject,â€ the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
â€œIâ€™m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.â€

â€œIâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t know one,â€ said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

â€œThen the Dormouse shall!â€ they both cried. â€œWake up, Dormouse!â€ And
they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. â€œI wasnâ€™t asleep,â€ he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: â€œI heard every word you fellows were saying.â€

â€œTell us a story!â€ said the March Hare.

â€œYes, please do!â€ pleaded Alice.

â€œAnd be quick about it,â€ added the Hatter, â€œor youâ€™ll be asleep again
before itâ€™s done.â€

â€œOnce upon a time there were three little sisters,â€ the Dormouse began
in a great hurry; â€œand their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a wellâ€”â€

â€œWhat did they live on?â€ said Alice, who always took a great interest
in questions of eating and drinking.

â€œThey lived on treacle,â€ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

â€œThey couldnâ€™t have done that, you know,â€ Alice gently remarked;
â€œtheyâ€™d have been ill.â€

â€œSo they were,â€ said the Dormouse; â€œ_very_ ill.â€

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: â€œBut
why did they live at the bottom of a well?â€

â€œTake some more tea,â€ the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

â€œIâ€™ve had nothing yet,â€ Alice replied in an offended tone, â€œso I canâ€™t
take more.â€

â€œYou mean you canâ€™t take _less_,â€ said the Hatter: â€œitâ€™s very easy to
take _more_ than nothing.â€

â€œNobody asked _your_ opinion,â€ said Alice.

â€œWhoâ€™s making personal remarks now?â€ the Hatter asked triumphantly.

Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
repeated her question. â€œWhy did they live at the bottom of a well?â€

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, â€œIt was a treacle-well.â€

â€œThereâ€™s no such thing!â€ Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went â€œSh! sh!â€ and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, â€œIf you canâ€™t be civil, youâ€™d better finish the story for
yourself.â€

â€œNo, please go on!â€ Alice said very humbly; â€œI wonâ€™t interrupt again. I
dare say there may be _one_.â€

â€œOne, indeed!â€ said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. â€œAnd so these three little sistersâ€”they were learning to draw,
you knowâ€”â€

â€œWhat did they draw?â€ said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

â€œTreacle,â€ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

â€œI want a clean cup,â€ interrupted the Hatter: â€œletâ€™s all move one place
on.â€

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouseâ€™s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: â€œBut I donâ€™t understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?â€

â€œYou can draw water out of a water-well,â€ said the Hatter; â€œso I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-wellâ€”eh, stupid?â€

â€œBut they were _in_ the well,â€ Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
to notice this last remark.

â€œOf course they were,â€ said the Dormouse; â€œâ€”well in.â€

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

â€œThey were learning to draw,â€ the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; â€œand they drew all manner of
thingsâ€”everything that begins with an Mâ€”â€

â€œWhy with an M?â€ said Alice.

â€œWhy not?â€ said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on: â€œâ€”that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchnessâ€”you know you say
things are â€œmuch of a muchnessâ€â€”did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?â€

â€œReally, now you ask me,â€ said Alice, very much confused, â€œI donâ€™t
thinkâ€”â€

â€œThen you shouldnâ€™t talk,â€ said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.

â€œAt any rate Iâ€™ll never go _there_ again!â€ said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood. â€œItâ€™s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life!â€

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. â€œThatâ€™s very curious!â€ she thought. â€œBut
everythingâ€™s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.â€ And
in she went.

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table. â€œNow, Iâ€™ll manage better this time,â€ she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot
high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_â€”she found
herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds
and the cool fountains.




CHAPTER VIII.
The Queenâ€™s Croquet-Ground


A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
one of them say, â€œLook out now, Five! Donâ€™t go splashing paint over me
like that!â€

â€œI couldnâ€™t help it,â€ said Five, in a sulky tone; â€œSeven jogged my
elbow.â€

On which Seven looked up and said, â€œThatâ€™s right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others!â€

â€œ_Youâ€™d_ better not talk!â€ said Five. â€œI heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!â€

â€œWhat for?â€ said the one who had spoken first.

â€œThatâ€™s none of _your_ business, Two!â€ said Seven.

â€œYes, it _is_ his business!â€ said Five, â€œand Iâ€™ll tell himâ€”it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.â€

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun â€œWell, of all the unjust
thingsâ€”â€ when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
and all of them bowed low.

â€œWould you tell me,â€ said Alice, a little timidly, â€œwhy you are
painting those roses?â€

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, â€œWhy the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
you see, Miss, weâ€™re doing our best, afore she comes, toâ€”â€ At this
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out â€œThe Queen! The Queen!â€ and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,
and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying
the Kingâ€™s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; â€œand besides, what would be the use of a
procession,â€ thought she, â€œif people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldnâ€™t see it?â€ So she stood still where she was,
and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely â€œWho is this?â€ She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

â€œIdiot!â€ said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
Alice, she went on, â€œWhatâ€™s your name, child?â€

â€œMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,â€ said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, â€œWhy, theyâ€™re only a pack of cards, after
all. I neednâ€™t be afraid of them!â€

â€œAnd who are _these?_â€ said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners
who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on
their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of her own children.

â€œHow should _I_ know?â€ said Alice, surprised at her own courage. â€œItâ€™s
no business of _mine_.â€

The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed â€œOff with her head! Offâ€”â€

â€œNonsense!â€ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said â€œConsider, my
dear: she is only a child!â€

The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave â€œTurn
them over!â€

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

â€œGet up!â€ said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.

â€œLeave off that!â€ screamed the Queen. â€œYou make me giddy.â€ And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, â€œWhat _have_ you been doing
here?â€

â€œMay it please your Majesty,â€ said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, â€œwe were tryingâ€”â€

â€œ_I_ see!â€ said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
â€œOff with their heads!â€ and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.

â€œYou shanâ€™t be beheaded!â€ said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.

â€œAre their heads off?â€ shouted the Queen.

â€œTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!â€ the soldiers shouted
in reply.

â€œThatâ€™s right!â€ shouted the Queen. â€œCan you play croquet?â€

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.

â€œYes!â€ shouted Alice.

â€œCome on, then!â€ roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

â€œItâ€™sâ€”itâ€™s a very fine day!â€ said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

â€œVery,â€ said Alice: â€œâ€”whereâ€™s the Duchess?â€

â€œHush! Hush!â€ said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered â€œSheâ€™s under
sentence of execution.â€

â€œWhat for?â€ said Alice.

â€œDid you say â€˜What a pity!â€™?â€ the Rabbit asked.

â€œNo, I didnâ€™t,â€ said Alice: â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s at all a pity. I said
â€˜What for?â€™â€

â€œShe boxed the Queenâ€™s earsâ€”â€ the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
scream of laughter. â€œOh, hush!â€ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. â€œThe Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen saidâ€”â€

â€œGet to your places!â€ shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting â€œOff with his head!â€ or â€œOff with her head!â€ about once in a
minute.

Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
â€œand then,â€ thought she, â€œwhat would become of me? Theyâ€™re dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that thereâ€™s any
one left alive!â€

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself â€œItâ€™s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to.â€

â€œHow are you getting on?â€ said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. â€œItâ€™s no use
speaking to it,â€ she thought, â€œtill its ears have come, or at least one
of them.â€ In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

â€œI donâ€™t think they play at all fairly,â€ Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, â€œand they all quarrel so dreadfully one canâ€™t hear
oneself speakâ€”and they donâ€™t seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to themâ€”and youâ€™ve no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, thereâ€™s the
arch Iâ€™ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
groundâ€”and I should have croqueted the Queenâ€™s hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!â€

â€œHow do you like the Queen?â€ said the Cat in a low voice.

â€œNot at all,â€ said Alice: â€œsheâ€™s so extremelyâ€”â€ Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
â€œâ€”likely to win, that itâ€™s hardly worth while finishing the game.â€

The Queen smiled and passed on.

â€œWho _are_ you talking to?â€ said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Catâ€™s head with great curiosity.

â€œItâ€™s a friend of mineâ€”a Cheshire Cat,â€ said Alice: â€œallow me to
introduce it.â€

â€œI donâ€™t like the look of it at all,â€ said the King: â€œhowever, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.â€

â€œIâ€™d rather not,â€ the Cat remarked.

â€œDonâ€™t be impertinent,â€ said the King, â€œand donâ€™t look at me like
that!â€ He got behind Alice as he spoke.

â€œA cat may look at a king,â€ said Alice. â€œIâ€™ve read that in some book,
but I donâ€™t remember where.â€

â€œWell, it must be removed,â€ said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, â€œMy dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!â€

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
small. â€œOff with his head!â€ she said, without even looking round.

â€œIâ€™ll fetch the executioner myself,â€ said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.

Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the Queenâ€™s voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: â€œbut it doesnâ€™t
matter much,â€ thought Alice, â€œas all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.â€ So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The executionerâ€™s argument was, that you couldnâ€™t cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasnâ€™t going to begin at _his_ time of life.

The Kingâ€™s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you werenâ€™t to talk nonsense.

The Queenâ€™s argument was, that if something wasnâ€™t done about it in
less than no time sheâ€™d have everybody executed, all round. (It was
this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but â€œIt belongs to the
Duchess: youâ€™d better ask _her_ about it.â€

â€œSheâ€™s in prison,â€ the Queen said to the executioner: â€œfetch her here.â€
And the executioner went off like an arrow.

The Catâ€™s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
while the rest of the party went back to the game.




CHAPTER IX.
The Mock Turtleâ€™s Story


â€œYou canâ€™t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!â€
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Aliceâ€™s,
and they walked off together.

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

â€œWhen _Iâ€™m_ a Duchess,â€ she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
tone though), â€œI wonâ€™t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
does very well withoutâ€”Maybe itâ€™s always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered,â€ she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, â€œand vinegar that makes them sourâ€”and camomile that makes
them bitterâ€”andâ€”and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldnâ€™t be
so stingy about it, you knowâ€”â€

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. â€œYouâ€™re thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I canâ€™t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit.â€

â€œPerhaps it hasnâ€™t one,â€ Alice ventured to remark.

â€œTut, tut, child!â€ said the Duchess. â€œEverythingâ€™s got a moral, if only
you can find it.â€ And she squeezed herself up closer to Aliceâ€™s side as
she spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Aliceâ€™s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

â€œThe gameâ€™s going on rather better now,â€ she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

â€œâ€™Tis so,â€ said the Duchess: â€œand the moral of that isâ€”â€˜Oh, â€™tis love,
â€™tis love, that makes the world go round!â€™â€

â€œSomebody said,â€ Alice whispered, â€œthat itâ€™s done by everybody minding
their own business!â€

â€œAh, well! It means much the same thing,â€ said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Aliceâ€™s shoulder as she added, â€œand the moral of
_that_ isâ€”â€˜Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.â€™â€

â€œHow fond she is of finding morals in things!â€ Alice thought to
herself.

â€œI dare say youâ€™re wondering why I donâ€™t put my arm round your waist,â€
the Duchess said after a pause: â€œthe reason is, that Iâ€™m doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?â€

â€œHe might bite,â€ Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.

â€œVery true,â€ said the Duchess: â€œflamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that isâ€”â€˜Birds of a feather flock together.â€™â€

â€œOnly mustard isnâ€™t a bird,â€ Alice remarked.

â€œRight, as usual,â€ said the Duchess: â€œwhat a clear way you have of
putting things!â€

â€œItâ€™s a mineral, I _think_,â€ said Alice.

â€œOf course it is,â€ said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; â€œthereâ€™s a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that isâ€”â€˜The more there is of mine, the less there is
of yours.â€™â€

â€œOh, I know!â€ exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
remark, â€œitâ€™s a vegetable. It doesnâ€™t look like one, but it is.â€

â€œI quite agree with you,â€ said the Duchess; â€œand the moral of that
isâ€”â€˜Be what you would seem to beâ€™â€”or if youâ€™d like it put more
simplyâ€”â€˜Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.â€™â€

â€œI think I should understand that better,â€ Alice said very politely,
â€œif I had it written down: but I canâ€™t quite follow it as you say it.â€

â€œThatâ€™s nothing to what I could say if I chose,â€ the Duchess replied,
in a pleased tone.

â€œPray donâ€™t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,â€ said
Alice.

â€œOh, donâ€™t talk about trouble!â€ said the Duchess. â€œI make you a present
of everything Iâ€™ve said as yet.â€

â€œA cheap sort of present!â€ thought Alice. â€œIâ€™m glad they donâ€™t give
birthday presents like that!â€ But she did not venture to say it out
loud.

â€œThinking again?â€ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

â€œIâ€™ve a right to think,â€ said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

â€œJust about as much right,â€ said the Duchess, â€œas pigs have to fly; and
the mâ€”â€

But here, to Aliceâ€™s great surprise, the Duchessâ€™s voice died away,
even in the middle of her favourite word â€˜moral,â€™ and the arm that was
linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the
Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
thunderstorm.

â€œA fine day, your Majesty!â€ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

â€œNow, I give you fair warning,â€ shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; â€œeither you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!â€

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

â€œLetâ€™s go on with the game,â€ the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queenâ€™s absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a momentâ€™s delay
would cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
with the other players, and shouting â€œOff with his head!â€ or â€œOff with
her head!â€ Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
and under sentence of execution.

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, â€œHave
you seen the Mock Turtle yet?â€

â€œNo,â€ said Alice. â€œI donâ€™t even know what a Mock Turtle is.â€

â€œItâ€™s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,â€ said the Queen.

â€œI never saw one, or heard of one,â€ said Alice.

â€œCome on, then,â€ said the Queen, â€œand he shall tell you his history,â€

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, â€œYou are all pardoned.â€ â€œCome, _thatâ€™s_ a
good thing!â€ she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If
you donâ€™t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) â€œUp, lazy
thing!â€ said the Queen, â€œand take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered;â€ and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. â€œWhat fun!â€ said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

â€œWhat _is_ the fun?â€ said Alice.

â€œWhy, _she_,â€ said the Gryphon. â€œItâ€™s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!â€

â€œEverybody says â€˜come on!â€™ here,â€ thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: â€œI never was so ordered about in all my life, never!â€

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
pitied him deeply. â€œWhat is his sorrow?â€ she asked the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, â€œItâ€™s all
his fancy, that: he hasnâ€™t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!â€

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

â€œThis here young lady,â€ said the Gryphon, â€œshe wants for to know your
history, she do.â€

â€œIâ€™ll tell it her,â€ said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: â€œsit
down, both of you, and donâ€™t speak a word till Iâ€™ve finished.â€

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, â€œI donâ€™t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesnâ€™t begin.â€
But she waited patiently.

â€œOnce,â€ said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, â€œI was a real
Turtle.â€

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of â€œHjckrrh!â€ from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, â€œThank you, sir, for your interesting story,â€ but she could not
help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

â€œWhen we were little,â€ the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, â€œwe went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtleâ€”we used to call him Tortoiseâ€”â€

â€œWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasnâ€™t one?â€ Alice asked.

â€œWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,â€ said the Mock Turtle
angrily: â€œreally you are very dull!â€

â€œYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,â€ added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, â€œDrive on, old fellow! Donâ€™t be all
day about it!â€ and he went on in these words:

â€œYes, we went to school in the sea, though you maynâ€™t believe itâ€”â€

â€œI never said I didnâ€™t!â€ interrupted Alice.

â€œYou did,â€ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œHold your tongue!â€ added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.

â€œWe had the best of educationsâ€”in fact, we went to school every dayâ€”â€

â€œ_Iâ€™ve_ been to a day-school, too,â€ said Alice; â€œyou neednâ€™t be so
proud as all that.â€

â€œWith extras?â€ asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

â€œYes,â€ said Alice, â€œwe learned French and music.â€

â€œAnd washing?â€ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œCertainly not!â€ said Alice indignantly.

â€œAh! then yours wasnâ€™t a really good school,â€ said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of great relief. â€œNow at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
â€˜French, music, _and washing_â€”extra.â€™â€

â€œYou couldnâ€™t have wanted it much,â€ said Alice; â€œliving at the bottom
of the sea.â€

â€œI couldnâ€™t afford to learn it.â€ said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. â€œI
only took the regular course.â€

â€œWhat was that?â€ inquired Alice.

â€œReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,â€ the Mock Turtle
replied; â€œand then the different branches of Arithmeticâ€”Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.â€

â€œI never heard of â€˜Uglification,â€™â€ Alice ventured to say. â€œWhat is it?â€

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. â€œWhat! Never heard of
uglifying!â€ it exclaimed. â€œYou know what to beautify is, I suppose?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Alice doubtfully: â€œit meansâ€”toâ€”makeâ€”anythingâ€”prettier.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ the Gryphon went on, â€œif you donâ€™t know what to uglify
is, you _are_ a simpleton.â€

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said â€œWhat else had you to learn?â€

â€œWell, there was Mystery,â€ the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, â€œâ€”Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawlingâ€”the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.â€

â€œWhat was _that_ like?â€ said Alice.

â€œWell, I canâ€™t show it you myself,â€ the Mock Turtle said: â€œIâ€™m too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.â€

â€œHadnâ€™t time,â€ said the Gryphon: â€œI went to the Classics master,
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.â€

â€œI never went to him,â€ the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: â€œhe taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.â€

â€œSo he did, so he did,â€ said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

â€œAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?â€ said Alice, in a hurry
to change the subject.

â€œTen hours the first day,â€ said the Mock Turtle: â€œnine the next, and so
on.â€

â€œWhat a curious plan!â€ exclaimed Alice.

â€œThatâ€™s the reason theyâ€™re called lessons,â€ the Gryphon remarked:
â€œbecause they lessen from day to day.â€

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. â€œThen the eleventh day must have been
a holiday?â€

â€œOf course it was,â€ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?â€ Alice went on eagerly.

â€œThatâ€™s enough about lessons,â€ the Gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone: â€œtell her something about the games now.â€




CHAPTER X.
The Lobster Quadrille


The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. â€œSame as if he had a bone in his throat,â€
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:â€”

â€œYou may not have lived much under the seaâ€”â€ (â€œI havenâ€™t,â€ said
Alice)â€”â€œand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobsterâ€”â€
(Alice began to say â€œI once tastedâ€”â€ but checked herself hastily, and
said â€œNo, neverâ€) â€œâ€”so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!â€

â€œNo, indeed,â€ said Alice. â€œWhat sort of a dance is it?â€

â€œWhy,â€ said the Gryphon, â€œyou first form into a line along the
sea-shoreâ€”â€

â€œTwo lines!â€ cried the Mock Turtle. â€œSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when youâ€™ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the wayâ€”â€

â€œ_That_ generally takes some time,â€ interrupted the Gryphon.

â€œâ€”you advance twiceâ€”â€

â€œEach with a lobster as a partner!â€ cried the Gryphon.

â€œOf course,â€ the Mock Turtle said: â€œadvance twice, set to partnersâ€”â€

â€œâ€”change lobsters, and retire in same order,â€ continued the Gryphon.

â€œThen, you know,â€ the Mock Turtle went on, â€œyou throw theâ€”â€

â€œThe lobsters!â€ shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

â€œâ€”as far out to sea as you canâ€”â€

â€œSwim after them!â€ screamed the Gryphon.

â€œTurn a somersault in the sea!â€ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.

â€œChange lobsters again!â€ yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

â€œBack to land again, and thatâ€™s all the first figure,â€ said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

â€œIt must be a very pretty dance,â€ said Alice timidly.

â€œWould you like to see a little of it?â€ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œVery much indeed,â€ said Alice.

â€œCome, letâ€™s try the first figure!â€ said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon. â€œWe can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?â€

â€œOh, _you_ sing,â€ said the Gryphon. â€œIâ€™ve forgotten the words.â€

So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:â€”

â€œWill you walk a little faster?â€ said a whiting to a snail.
â€œThereâ€™s a porpoise close behind us, and heâ€™s treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingleâ€”will you come and join the dance?
Will you, wonâ€™t you, will you, wonâ€™t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, wonâ€™t you, will you, wonâ€™t you, wonâ€™t you join the dance?

â€œYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!â€
But the snail replied â€œToo far, too far!â€ and gave a look askanceâ€”
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

â€œWhat matters it how far we go?â€ his scaly friend replied.
â€œThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to Franceâ€”
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, wonâ€™t you, will you, wonâ€™t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, wonâ€™t you, will you, wonâ€™t you, wonâ€™t you join the dance?â€


â€œThank you, itâ€™s a very interesting dance to watch,â€ said Alice,
feeling very glad that it was over at last: â€œand I do so like that
curious song about the whiting!â€

â€œOh, as to the whiting,â€ said the Mock Turtle, â€œtheyâ€”youâ€™ve seen them,
of course?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Alice, â€œIâ€™ve often seen them at dinnâ€”â€ she checked herself
hastily.

â€œI donâ€™t know where Dinn may be,â€ said the Mock Turtle, â€œbut if youâ€™ve
seen them so often, of course you know what theyâ€™re like.â€

â€œI believe so,â€ Alice replied thoughtfully. â€œThey have their tails in
their mouthsâ€”and theyâ€™re all over crumbs.â€

â€œYouâ€™re wrong about the crumbs,â€ said the Mock Turtle: â€œcrumbs would
all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;
and the reason isâ€”â€ here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
eyes.â€”â€œTell her about the reason and all that,â€ he said to the Gryphon.

â€œThe reason is,â€ said the Gryphon, â€œthat they _would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
couldnâ€™t get them out again. Thatâ€™s all.â€

â€œThank you,â€ said Alice, â€œitâ€™s very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.â€

â€œI can tell you more than that, if you like,â€ said the Gryphon. â€œDo you
know why itâ€™s called a whiting?â€

â€œI never thought about it,â€ said Alice. â€œWhy?â€

â€œ_It does the boots and shoes_,â€ the Gryphon replied very solemnly.

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. â€œDoes the boots and shoes!â€ she repeated
in a wondering tone.

â€œWhy, what are _your_ shoes done with?â€ said the Gryphon. â€œI mean, what
makes them so shiny?â€

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. â€œTheyâ€™re done with blacking, I believe.â€

â€œBoots and shoes under the sea,â€ the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
â€œare done with a whiting. Now you know.â€

â€œAnd what are they made of?â€ Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

â€œSoles and eels, of course,â€ the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
â€œany shrimp could have told you that.â€

â€œIf Iâ€™d been the whiting,â€ said Alice, whose thoughts were still
running on the song, â€œIâ€™d have said to the porpoise, â€˜Keep back,
please: we donâ€™t want _you_ with us!â€™â€

â€œThey were obliged to have him with them,â€ the Mock Turtle said: â€œno
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.â€

â€œWouldnâ€™t it really?â€ said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

â€œOf course not,â€ said the Mock Turtle: â€œwhy, if a fish came to _me_,
and told me he was going a journey, I should say â€˜With what porpoise?â€™â€

â€œDonâ€™t you mean â€˜purposeâ€™?â€ said Alice.

â€œI mean what I say,â€ the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
the Gryphon added â€œCome, letâ€™s hear some of _your_ adventures.â€

â€œI could tell you my adventuresâ€”beginning from this morning,â€ said
Alice a little timidly: â€œbut itâ€™s no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.â€

â€œExplain all that,â€ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œNo, no! The adventures first,â€ said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
â€œexplanations take such a dreadful time.â€

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
about her repeating â€œ_You are old, Father William_,â€ to the
Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
Turtle drew a long breath, and said â€œThatâ€™s very curious.â€

â€œItâ€™s all about as curious as it can be,â€ said the Gryphon.

â€œIt all came different!â€ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. â€œI
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.â€ He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.

â€œStand up and repeat â€˜â€™_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,â€™â€ said the
Gryphon.

â€œHow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!â€
thought Alice; â€œI might as well be at school at once.â€ However, she got
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:â€”

â€œâ€™Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
â€œYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.â€
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.â€

[later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]


â€œThatâ€™s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,â€ said
the Gryphon.

â€œWell, I never heard it before,â€ said the Mock Turtle; â€œbut it sounds
uncommon nonsense.â€

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.

â€œI should like to have it explained,â€ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œShe canâ€™t explain it,â€ said the Gryphon hastily. â€œGo on with the next
verse.â€

â€œBut about his toes?â€ the Mock Turtle persisted. â€œHow _could_ he turn
them out with his nose, you know?â€

â€œItâ€™s the first position in dancing.â€ Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

â€œGo on with the next verse,â€ the Gryphon repeated impatiently: â€œit
begins â€˜_I passed by his garden_.â€™â€

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:â€”

â€œI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pieâ€”â€

[later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquetâ€”]


â€œWhat _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,â€ the Mock Turtle
interrupted, â€œif you donâ€™t explain it as you go on? Itâ€™s by far the
most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!â€

â€œYes, I think youâ€™d better leave off,â€ said the Gryphon: and Alice was
only too glad to do so.

â€œShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?â€ the Gryphon
went on. â€œOr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?â€

â€œOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,â€ Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
â€œHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her â€˜_Turtle Soup_,â€™ will you, old
fellow?â€

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:â€”

â€œBeautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Beauâ€”ootiful Sooâ€”oop!
    Beauâ€”ootiful Sooâ€”oop!
Sooâ€”oop of the eâ€”eâ€”evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

â€œBeautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Beauâ€”ootiful Sooâ€”oop!
    Beauâ€”ootiful Sooâ€”oop!
Sooâ€”oop of the eâ€”eâ€”evening,
    Beautiful, beautiâ€”FUL SOUP!â€


â€œChorus again!â€ cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of â€œThe trialâ€™s beginning!â€ was heard in the
distance.

â€œCome on!â€ cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

â€œWhat trial is it?â€ Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered â€œCome on!â€ and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:â€”

â€œSooâ€”oop of the eâ€”eâ€”evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!â€




CHAPTER XI.
Who Stole the Tarts?


The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about themâ€”all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themâ€”â€œI wish theyâ€™d
get the trial done,â€ she thought, â€œand hand round the refreshments!â€
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
everything about her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. â€œThatâ€™s the judge,â€ she said to
herself, â€œbecause of his great wig.â€

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he
did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

â€œAnd thatâ€™s the jury-box,â€ thought Alice, â€œand those twelve creatures,â€
(she was obliged to say â€œcreatures,â€ you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) â€œI suppose they are the jurors.â€ She
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, â€œjury-menâ€
would have done just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. â€œWhat are
they doing?â€ Alice whispered to the Gryphon. â€œThey canâ€™t have anything
to put down yet, before the trialâ€™s begun.â€

â€œTheyâ€™re putting down their names,â€ the Gryphon whispered in reply,
â€œfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.â€

â€œStupid things!â€ Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, â€œSilence in the
court!â€ and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
to make out who was talking.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down â€œstupid things!â€ on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didnâ€™t know how to spell
â€œstupid,â€ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. â€œA nice
muddle their slatesâ€™ll be in before the trialâ€™s over!â€ thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

â€œHerald, read the accusation!â€ said the King.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:â€”

â€œThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!â€


â€œConsider your verdict,â€ the King said to the jury.

â€œNot yet, not yet!â€ the Rabbit hastily interrupted. â€œThereâ€™s a great
deal to come before that!â€

â€œCall the first witness,â€ said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, â€œFirst witness!â€

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. â€œI beg pardon, your
Majesty,â€ he began, â€œfor bringing these in: but I hadnâ€™t quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.â€

â€œYou ought to have finished,â€ said the King. â€œWhen did you begin?â€

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. â€œFourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was,â€ he said.

â€œFifteenth,â€ said the March Hare.

â€œSixteenth,â€ added the Dormouse.

â€œWrite that down,â€ the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

â€œTake off your hat,â€ the King said to the Hatter.

â€œIt isnâ€™t mine,â€ said the Hatter.

â€œ_Stolen!_â€ the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.

â€œI keep them to sell,â€ the Hatter added as an explanation; â€œIâ€™ve none
of my own. Iâ€™m a hatter.â€

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

â€œGive your evidence,â€ said the King; â€œand donâ€™t be nervous, or Iâ€™ll
have you executed on the spot.â€

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.

â€œI wish you wouldnâ€™t squeeze so.â€ said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. â€œI can hardly breathe.â€

â€œI canâ€™t help it,â€ said Alice very meekly: â€œIâ€™m growing.â€

â€œYouâ€™ve no right to grow _here_,â€ said the Dormouse.

â€œDonâ€™t talk nonsense,â€ said Alice more boldly: â€œyou know youâ€™re growing
too.â€

â€œYes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,â€ said the Dormouse: â€œnot in
that ridiculous fashion.â€ And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court.

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, â€œBring me the list of the singers in the last concert!â€
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
off.

â€œGive your evidence,â€ the King repeated angrily, â€œor Iâ€™ll have you
executed, whether youâ€™re nervous or not.â€

â€œIâ€™m a poor man, your Majesty,â€ the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
â€œâ€”and I hadnâ€™t begun my teaâ€”not above a week or soâ€”and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thinâ€”and the twinkling of the teaâ€”â€

â€œThe twinkling of the _what?_â€ said the King.

â€œIt _began_ with the tea,â€ the Hatter replied.

â€œOf course twinkling begins with a T!â€ said the King sharply. â€œDo you
take me for a dunce? Go on!â€

â€œIâ€™m a poor man,â€ the Hatter went on, â€œand most things twinkled after
thatâ€”only the March Hare saidâ€”â€

â€œI didnâ€™t!â€ the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

â€œYou did!â€ said the Hatter.

â€œI deny it!â€ said the March Hare.

â€œHe denies it,â€ said the King: â€œleave out that part.â€

â€œWell, at any rate, the Dormouse saidâ€”â€ the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

â€œAfter that,â€ continued the Hatter, â€œI cut some more bread-and-butterâ€”â€

â€œBut what did the Dormouse say?â€ one of the jury asked.

â€œThat I canâ€™t remember,â€ said the Hatter.

â€œYou _must_ remember,â€ remarked the King, â€œor Iâ€™ll have you executed.â€

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. â€œIâ€™m a poor man, your Majesty,â€ he began.

â€œYouâ€™re a _very_ poor _speaker_,â€ said the King.

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)

â€œIâ€™m glad Iâ€™ve seen that done,â€ thought Alice. â€œIâ€™ve so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, â€œThere was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,â€ and I never understood what it meant till now.â€

â€œIf thatâ€™s all you know about it, you may stand down,â€ continued the
King.

â€œI canâ€™t go no lower,â€ said the Hatter: â€œIâ€™m on the floor, as it is.â€

â€œThen you may _sit_ down,â€ the King replied.

Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

â€œCome, that finished the guinea-pigs!â€ thought Alice. â€œNow we shall get
on better.â€

â€œIâ€™d rather finish my tea,â€ said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

â€œYou may go,â€ said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

â€œâ€”and just take his head off outside,â€ the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

â€œCall the next witness!â€ said the King.

The next witness was the Duchessâ€™s cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

â€œGive your evidence,â€ said the King.

â€œShanâ€™t,â€ said the cook.

The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
â€œYour Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.â€

â€œWell, if I must, I must,â€ the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, â€œWhat are tarts made of?â€

â€œPepper, mostly,â€ said the cook.

â€œTreacle,â€ said a sleepy voice behind her.

â€œCollar that Dormouse,â€ the Queen shrieked out. â€œBehead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!â€

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

â€œNever mind!â€ said the King, with an air of great relief. â€œCall the
next witness.â€ And he added in an undertone to the Queen, â€œReally, my
dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
forehead ache!â€

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
very curious to see what the next witness would be like, â€œâ€”for they
havenâ€™t got much evidence _yet_,â€ she said to herself. Imagine her
surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
little voice, the name â€œAlice!â€




CHAPTER XII.
Aliceâ€™s Evidence


â€œHere!â€ cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.

â€œOh, I _beg_ your pardon!â€ she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
jury-box, or they would die.

â€œThe trial cannot proceed,â€ said the King in a very grave voice, â€œuntil
all the jurymen are back in their proper placesâ€”_all_,â€ he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.

Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon
got it out again, and put it right; â€œnot that it signifies much,â€ she
said to herself; â€œI should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
trial one way up as the other.â€

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

â€œWhat do you know about this business?â€ the King said to Alice.

â€œNothing,â€ said Alice.

â€œNothing _whatever?_â€ persisted the King.

â€œNothing whatever,â€ said Alice.

â€œThatâ€™s very important,â€ the King said, turning to the jury. They were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
Rabbit interrupted: â€œ_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,â€ he
said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
he spoke.

â€œ_Un_important, of course, I meant,â€ the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

â€œimportantâ€”unimportantâ€”unimportantâ€”importantâ€”â€ as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down â€œimportant,â€ and some â€œunimportant.â€
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
â€œbut it doesnâ€™t matter a bit,â€ she thought to herself.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out â€œSilence!â€ and read out from his book, â€œRule
Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.â€

Everybody looked at Alice.

â€œ_Iâ€™m_ not a mile high,â€ said Alice.

â€œYou are,â€ said the King.

â€œNearly two miles high,â€ added the Queen.

â€œWell, I shanâ€™t go, at any rate,â€ said Alice: â€œbesides, thatâ€™s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.â€

â€œItâ€™s the oldest rule in the book,â€ said the King.

â€œThen it ought to be Number One,â€ said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. â€œConsider your
verdict,â€ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

â€œThereâ€™s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,â€ said the
White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; â€œthis paper has just been
picked up.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s in it?â€ said the Queen.

â€œI havenâ€™t opened it yet,â€ said the White Rabbit, â€œbut it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner toâ€”to somebody.â€

â€œIt must have been that,â€ said the King, â€œunless it was written to
nobody, which isnâ€™t usual, you know.â€

â€œWho is it directed to?â€ said one of the jurymen.

â€œIt isnâ€™t directed at all,â€ said the White Rabbit; â€œin fact, thereâ€™s
nothing written on the _outside_.â€ He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added â€œIt isnâ€™t a letter, after all: itâ€™s a set of verses.â€

â€œAre they in the prisonerâ€™s handwriting?â€ asked another of the jurymen.

â€œNo, theyâ€™re not,â€ said the White Rabbit, â€œand thatâ€™s the queerest
thing about it.â€ (The jury all looked puzzled.)

â€œHe must have imitated somebody elseâ€™s hand,â€ said the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)

â€œPlease your Majesty,â€ said the Knave, â€œI didnâ€™t write it, and they
canâ€™t prove I did: thereâ€™s no name signed at the end.â€

â€œIf you didnâ€™t sign it,â€ said the King, â€œthat only makes the matter
worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else youâ€™d have signed
your name like an honest man.â€

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the King had said that day.

â€œThat _proves_ his guilt,â€ said the Queen.

â€œIt proves nothing of the sort!â€ said Alice. â€œWhy, you donâ€™t even know
what theyâ€™re about!â€

â€œRead them,â€ said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. â€œWhere shall I begin, please
your Majesty?â€ he asked.

â€œBegin at the beginning,â€ the King said gravely, â€œand go on till you
come to the end: then stop.â€

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:â€”

â€œThey told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

Donâ€™t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.â€


â€œThatâ€™s the most important piece of evidence weâ€™ve heard yet,â€ said the
King, rubbing his hands; â€œso now let the juryâ€”â€

â€œIf any one of them can explain it,â€ said Alice, (she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasnâ€™t a bit afraid of
interrupting him,) â€œIâ€™ll give him sixpence. _I_ donâ€™t believe thereâ€™s
an atom of meaning in it.â€

The jury all wrote down on their slates, â€œ_She_ doesnâ€™t believe thereâ€™s
an atom of meaning in it,â€ but none of them attempted to explain the
paper.

â€œIf thereâ€™s no meaning in it,â€ said the King, â€œthat saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we neednâ€™t try to find any. And yet I donâ€™t
know,â€ he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye; â€œI seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
â€œâ€”_said I could not swim_â€”â€ you canâ€™t swim, can you?â€ he added, turning
to the Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. â€œDo I look like it?â€ he said. (Which he
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)

â€œAll right, so far,â€ said the King, and he went on muttering over the
verses to himself: â€œâ€˜_We know it to be true_â€”â€™ thatâ€™s the jury, of
courseâ€”â€˜_I gave her one, they gave him two_â€”â€™ why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you knowâ€”â€

â€œBut, it goes on â€˜_they all returned from him to you_,â€™â€ said Alice.

â€œWhy, there they are!â€ said the King triumphantly, pointing to the
tarts on the table. â€œNothing can be clearer than _that_. Then
againâ€”â€˜_before she had this fit_â€”â€™ you never had fits, my dear, I
think?â€ he said to the Queen.

â€œNever!â€ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long
as it lasted.)

â€œThen the words donâ€™t _fit_ you,â€ said the King, looking round the
court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

â€œItâ€™s a pun!â€ the King added in an offended tone, and everybody
laughed, â€œLet the jury consider their verdict,â€ the King said, for
about the twentieth time that day.

â€œNo, no!â€ said the Queen. â€œSentence firstâ€”verdict afterwards.â€

â€œStuff and nonsense!â€ said Alice loudly. â€œThe idea of having the
sentence first!â€

â€œHold your tongue!â€ said the Queen, turning purple.

â€œI wonâ€™t!â€ said Alice.

â€œOff with her head!â€ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
moved.

â€œWho cares for you?â€ said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by
this time.) â€œYouâ€™re nothing but a pack of cards!â€

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

â€œWake up, Alice dear!â€ said her sister; â€œWhy, what a long sleep youâ€™ve
had!â€

â€œOh, Iâ€™ve had such a curious dream!â€ said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she
had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, â€œIt _was_ a curious
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; itâ€™s getting late.â€
So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.


But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all
her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
and this was her dream:â€”

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hersâ€”she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that _would_ always get into her eyesâ€”and still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sisterâ€™s dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried byâ€”the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolâ€”she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to executionâ€”once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchessâ€™s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around itâ€”once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizardâ€™s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull realityâ€”the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsâ€”the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queenâ€™s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boyâ€”and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yardâ€”while the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
Turtleâ€™s heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
days.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
